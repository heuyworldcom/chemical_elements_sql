# chemical_elements_sql

So last night i was scouring the web for an imporatable dataset containing information about the chemical elements. I tried importing from
2 copied html tables. It was close but no cigar. Then here on git i found a .csv file. It too had its problems when trying to use the data
to convert into sql INSERT statements.

As im falling asleep i came up with an idea on how to get it to convert well. And this morning it worked out great.

So i wanted to share these .sql files with you all. They contain mySQL statements to create a database (elementary), table (elements),
and all the INSERT statements too!

### PLEASE NOTE ###
As this sql's source was from a .csv file the column "density" must of had large numbers in it and so was dumped as, for example, 
"5.34E-01". Not sure if i'll need that column but if i do then i will update accordingly and share up here

Have at it!
